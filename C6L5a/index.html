					Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the background
					content (i.e., an image) is moved at a different speed than the
					foreground content while scrolling. This effect is widely used to
					create a sense of depth and engagement on web pages. By employing
					parallax scrolling, designers can make websites more dynamic and
					visually appealing, often resulting in a better user experience.

					The parallax effect can be achieved through various methods, including
					CSS, JavaScript, and HTML5. It is important to use this technique
					judiciously, as overuse can lead to performance issues, especially on
					mobile devices. Well-implemented parallax scrolling can enhance the
					storytelling aspect of a website, guiding users through the content in
					a more interactive and engaging manner.
